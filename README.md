# hinshaw-backend-1

A simple web app to demonstrate a basic registration/authentication flow and backend implementation.

Tech:

*API* - Written in Golang with the Echo framework. Chose Echo because I like it and I've been using it recently 
on a project, so it sped up development by familiarity. 

*Database* - Postgres, this is just my goto open-source database.

*Cache* - TODO MAYBE?? Redis, another goto for key/val storage.

*NGINX/HTML* - Pages built with basic html and javascript (bare-bones), served by a simple NGINX web server.

*NGINX* - Reverse proxy for API request routing.
